What you should do in order to build this project:
  1. Make sure you have cmake installed
  2. Go to the project root
  3. Make sure that all libraries dependencies are correctly satisfied in the "cmake/BuildSetup.cmake" file
     Note that project requires:
        - Qt        (v4)
        - SOF       (v1.2_11050)
        - PROCPS    (v3.2.8)
        - [Log4cxx  (v0.10)]
  3. Create a "build" directory and enter to it
  4. Type the command lines:
    $ cmake -C ../cmake/BuildSetup.cmake ..
    $ make test
    $ make install
  5. So you can see created library or executable (depending on the project)

What you should do in order to develop on this project (e.g Eclipse CDT IDE):
  1. Make sure you have cmake installed
  2. Go to the project root
  3. Make sure that all libraries dependencies are correctly satisfied in the "cmake/BuildSetup.cmake" file
     Note that project requires:
        - Qt        (v4)
        - SOF       (v1.2_11050)
        - PROCPS    (v3.2.8)
        - [Log4cxx  (v0.10)]
  4. Prefer the out-of-source build and go to the parent directory (so now you are above the project source directory (ESF-src))
  5. Create the project build directory (ESF-build) an enter to it
  6. Type the command line:
    $ cmake -G"Eclipse CDT4 - Unix Makefiles" -C../ESF-src/cmake/BuildSetup.cmake ../ESF-src
  7. Open your Eclipse CDT IDE and import the ESF-build project. Note that you have the ESF-src sources linked to it
